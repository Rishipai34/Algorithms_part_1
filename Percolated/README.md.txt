Percolation 
1. test
a. Create an n by n field which has initially all blocked cells \
b. Randomly open cells (connecting adjacent open cells) until the top and bottom are connected (The system percolates)
c. Find the ratio od open sites to total sites (Required probability p)
2. Rpeat test for many trials and find the value of mean p, standard deviation, 95% confidence intervals 
note:
JAR file used is developed at princeton with required data structures and algorithms that are used in the simulation
